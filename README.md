# Homework 1: semantic-tagging
## Objective:

The objective of this assignment was to take a given code and refactor it to add semantic tags and add accesibility tags
as needed. To start, I updated the title so that the tab would have a unique identifier in the users browser. Next,I added the following semantic tags: header, nav, section, and aside. To add the nav tag, I had to go to the style.css sheet and updated the class tags so that the code would read it correctly. I also added an <id> tag to the search-engine-optimization section so that when you click on the link from the header/navigation bar it would take you to the correct section.
